Case Study: Network Design and Requirements

Overview

Vignan’s Institute of Information Technology (VIIT) encompasses a sprawling campus with two academic blocks dedicated to Engineering disciplines, strategically located 10 miles apart. The campus hosts a diverse community of students and staff across six majors, including Computer Science, Electronics, IT, Civil, Mech, and Electrical. This case study details the design and implementation of a network topology to efficiently support the institution’s academic and administrative activities.

Campus Configuration

1. Academic Blocks

Dharithri Block: This block accommodates all departments, exclusively for first-year students.
Main Block: This block hosts all departments catering to second, third, and fourth-year students, with the exception of IT majors, which are present across all years.   

2. Network Requirements

•	Each department/faculty is expected to be on its own separate IP network.
•	The switches should be configured with appropriate VLANs and security settings.
•	RIPv2 will be used to provide routing for the routers in the internal network and static routing for the external server.
•	The devices in building A will be expected to acquire dynamic IP addresses from a router-based DHCP server.
Configure in Packet Tracer the network with appropriate settings to achieve the connectivity and functionalities specified in the requirements.

3. Technologies Implemented
•	Creating a network topology using Cisco Packet Tracer.
•	Hierarchical Network Design.
•	Connecting Networking devices with Correct cabling.
•	Creating VLANs and assigning ports VLAN numbers.
•	Subnetting and IP Addressing.
•	Configuring Inter-VLAN Routing (Router on a stick).
•	Configuring DHCP Server (Router as the DHCP Server).
•	Configuring SSH for secure Remote access.
•	Configuring RIPv2 as the routing protocol.
•	Configuring switchport security or Port-Security on the switches.
•	Host Device Configurations.
•	Test and Verifying Network Communication.
